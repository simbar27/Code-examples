# Studies codes
This repository is for the codes and notebooks that I have produced in the scope of my studies.
However, they are not all and should rather serve as little bits of example.

Here you can get familiar with some R and Python scripts, however, I also have experience writing code for SQL, Excel (VBA) and
and some knowledge of Power Query.
